<h1>Gig Manager</h1>
<p>
This is a server application built with <a href="https://nestjs.com" >NestJS</a> for freelance event production personel (sound, lighting, video engineers, stagehands etc...) designed to facilitate the management of schedules, job information, billing, all in one app. 
  
In its current state it just stores user info in MongoDB. However eventually it will be a one stop shop for freelance technicians to manage their schedule, and generate invoices easier based on industry standard billing practices.
